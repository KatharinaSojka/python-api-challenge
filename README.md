# python-api-challenge

Please find attached my solution to the API Challenge.
Repository consists of 2 folders, one for each  deliverable: WeatherPY and VacationsPY. 
WeatherPY has a subfolder output_date, containg a csv file with cities, and 4 png files with plots.

Please note, that I was not able to test hovering messages in Vacation section. For some reason I was never able to make my jupiter notebook interactive.
Several attemps by my, with the help of the teacher were note succesfull.
I did include a code, adding hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message, however I could not test it.

Thanks,

Katharina
